The current version of the hardware design is v1.8.

It comes in two variants, a minimal variant that blocks only the four pins necessary for it to work (v1.8), and a second variant (v1.8shim that covers the remaining two power pins (no electrical connection, simply for added stability) and provides a mounting hole.
